# Efficient-P.U.M.P.S.
A simple mod-mod that adds some rescaling options to OldSkoolMatt's Offshore P.U.M.P.S. Factorio mod

OldSkoolMatt's [Offshore P.U.M.P.S. and Ground Water](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/P-U-M-P-S) mod is a brilliant idea that I just had to snap up and start playing with, but I found the power scaling of the offshore pumps to be far too steep for my preferences.

So I wrote this little mod-mod that adds options to rescale the Offshore P.U.M.P.S. to be more energy efficient, while still costing energy to operate! Includes rescaling factors of divide-by-1 (no rescaling), divide-by-10, and divide-by-100 (pumpjacks max out at /10 because otherwise they would be *too* efficient!).

Also includes options to rescale the fluid pump's energy requirements to match the geometric progression of the extra offshore pump tiers, as well as to make the burner pump *even more inefficient* because by the laws of thermodynamics combustion engines can only ever be at most 50% efficient!

I cannot guarantee this mod-mod will play nicely if any other mods compatible with OSM's Offshore P.U.M.P.S. are also installed and active, since I don't play with any of those other mods, but I am receptive to detailed bug reports and pull requests on the git repo. :)

NOTE: This is NOT a reupload of OSM's Offshore P.U.M.P.S. This mod REQUIRES OSM's Offshore P.U.M.P.S.
