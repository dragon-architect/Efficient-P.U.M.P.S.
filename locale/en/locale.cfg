[mod-setting-description]
efficient-pumps-rescale-power-factor=Divides the energy requirement of OSM's Offshore P.U.M.P.S. by this number. Pumpjacks max out at /10.
efficient-pumps-rescale-fluid-pump=Rescales the energy requirement of the vanilla onshore fluid pump to match the arithmetic progression of Offshore P.U.M.P.S.
efficient-pumps-inefficient-burner=Makes burner offshore pumps MORE inefficient, because combustion engines can only ever be at most 50% efficient!
